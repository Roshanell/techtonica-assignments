## Recipe Card
This recipe card gave me the opportunity to practice more with the DOM. 




# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


# Optimizations:

I'd like to refactor the code in order to:
1. Have the Change theme button toggle between two themes(both light and dark)
2. Replace current ingredient list to the one created via the DOM.


# Lessons Learned:

The DOM is challenging but it is possible to get create, remove, and add things to your HTML file without using actual HTMl elements.
